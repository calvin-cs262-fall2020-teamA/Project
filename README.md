## Streamlining dorm delivery for Calvin University

### Our Vision

The Mercury Package Management app seeks to provide a simple and hassle-free platform for managing deliveries for Calvinâ€™s Residence Halls, and notifying the intended recipients. Currently, dorm deskies keep track of packages using a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This table keeps track of the recipient, their room number, and the date the package arrived. Deskies then notify the recipients over email that their package has arrived. This manual submission process can be rather slow, especially at certain times of the year when packages are filing in quickly. At times, we have heard of stories where packages could be not picked up by their recipients because the deskie could not sort them in a timely fashion before their shift was over. Our hope is that automating this system will quicken the sorting process up and get the packages into the hands of the recipients more efficiently. 

Mercury Package Management will improve this process by securing package information in a database (instead of a spreadsheet), automating the recipient notification process, and providing an intuitive and rapid interface to log and disperse packages.
