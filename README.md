## Streamlining dorm delivery for Calvin University

### Our Vision

The Mercury Package Management app seeks to provide a simple and hassle-free platform for managing deliveries for Calvinâ€™s Residence Halls, and notifying the intended recipients. Currently, dorm deskies keep track of packages using a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This table keeps track of the recipient, their room number, and the date the package arrived. Deskies then notify the recipients over email that their package has arrived.
Mercury Package Management will improve this process by securing package information in a database (instead of a spreadsheet), automating the recipient notification process, and providing an intuitive and rapid interface to log and disperse packages.
